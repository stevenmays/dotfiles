# Simplify

Simplify this code while keeping behavior identical.

## Actions

1. Replace nested conditionals with early returns
2. Extract complex expressions into named variables
3. Remove unnecessary abstractions
4. Combine related operations
5. Remove dead code and unused variables
6. Reduce function length (aim for under 20 lines)
7. Inline single-use helper functions
8. Inline single-use variables (unless inlining makes the line excessively long)
9. Remove redundant type assertions

## Output

Output only the simplified code. No explanations unless the change is non-obvious.

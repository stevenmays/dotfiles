## Core Principles
- Write immediately understandable code
- Simplify if it feels complex
- Readability first, performance second
- Use standard libraries, don't reinvent

## Functions
- Single responsibility, under 20 lines
- 3 or fewer parameters
- Early returns over nested conditionals
- Pure functions where possible

## Error Handling
- Handle errors at function top level
- Throw real Error objects with context
- Don't use errors for control flow

## TypeScript
- Let TypeScript infer return types
- Interfaces for objects, type for unions
- Angle brackets for casts: <Type>value
- Type guards for runtime validation
- Avoid `any` - use `unknown` instead

## Naming
- camelCase for variables/functions
- kebab-case for files
- snake_case for database/API fields

## Imports
- ES modules only (no require)
- Prefer namespace imports: import * as lib from 'lib'

## Avoid These AI Patterns
- Excessive comments stating the obvious
- Defensive checks on already-validated data
- Casting to `any` to silence type errors
- Unnecessary wrappers or single-use abstractions
- More logging than the file's existing pattern
- Style inconsistent with the rest of the file
